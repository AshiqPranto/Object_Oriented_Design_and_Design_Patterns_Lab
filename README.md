Computer Science & Engineering Department
University of Rajshahi, Bangladesh</h1>

<h2>Lab Experiment List on Object Oriented Analysis and Design</h2>

    1. Write a Java Program that demonstrate multiple interface/inheritance. You are free to choose application for demonstrating multiple interface/inheritance.
    2. Write a Java program to demonstrate a PET management systemâ€”which can be PET shop, PET care, PET service. You have to follow appropriate object-oriented design concept to implement the tasks.
